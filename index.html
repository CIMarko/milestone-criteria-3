                                    features. There is a range of features, including creation, location, deletion and

                                    data records. Data validation, and user feedback are all evident in the code and the

                                    application. Templates have been used correctly produce working features. There are

                                <p>The finished project has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of a
                                    particular
                                    target audience (or multiple related audiences) and a particular data domain. Its
                                    purpose
                                    would be immediately evident to a new user without having to look at supporting
                                    documentation. The user is kept informed of progress and actions through feedback
                                    and,
                                    where large data sets are being loaded, progress indicators. The design of the web
                                    application follows the principles of UX design and accessibility guidelines and the
                                    site is
                                    fully responsive.

                                <p>Data is fully modelled and matches the schema. The schema design is documented in the
                                    README. Data store configuration is kept in a single location and can be changed
                                    easily.
                                    Configuration and settings files are well-organised and there are different versions
                                    for
                                    different branches.

                                <p>Code is well-organised and easy to follow and the application has been fully tested,
                                    following
                                    a manual testing procedure, with no obvious errors left in the code. </p>
                                <p>The development process is clearly evident through commit messages. The project’s
                                    documentation provides a clear rationale for the development of this project and
                                    covers all
                                    stages of the development life cycle.

                                <p><strong>Characteristics of performance at DISTINCTION:</strong></p>

                                <p>The learner has documented a clear, justified, rationale for a real-world application
                                    and a
                                    comprehensive explanation of how it will be developed. The development of the
                                    project has
                                    resulted in a fully-functioning, interactive, Full Stack application, with
                                    well-designed data and
                                    a full set of CRUD data operations. The learner shows a clear understanding of data
                                    modelling techniques and of the relationship between the Back end and Front end.
                                </p>

                                <p>The finished project is judged to be publishable in its current form with a
                                    professional grade
                                    user interface and functionality, and interaction adhering to current practice.
                                    There are no
                                    logic errors in the code. Where there is a clear breach of accepted design/UX
                                    principles, or of accepted good practice in code organisation, these are fully
                                    justified, appropriate and
                                    acceptable to the target user. It clearly matches the design and demonstrates the
                                    characteristics of craftsmanship in the code. The database schema is representative
                                    of
                                    complex user stories and there is a fully documented and full set of data operations
                                    which
                                    are fit for purpose in relation to the domain. The resulting application is original
                                    and not a
                                    copy of any walkthrough projects encountered in the unit</p>

                                <p><strong>Design</strong></p>
                                <p>The design of the web application demonstrates the main principles of good UX design:
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Information Hierarchy</strong></p>
                                <p>Semantic markup is used to convey structure - all information displayed on the site
                                    is presented in an organised fashion with each piece of information being easy to
                                    find. All resources on the site are easy to find, allowing users to navigate the
                                    layout of the site intuitively. Information is presented and categorised in terms of
                                    its priority.</p>
                                <p><strong>User Control</strong></p>
                                <p>All interaction with the site would be likely to produce a positive emotional
                                    response within the user. This is down to the flow of information layout, use of
                                    colour, clear and unambiguous navigation structures and all interaction feedback.
                                    When displaying media files, the site avoids aggressive automatic pop-ups and
                                    autoplay of audio; instead letting the user initiate and control such actions. Users
                                    who direct to a non-existent page or resource are redirected back to the main page
                                    without having to use the browser navigation buttons. Users are never asked for
                                    information that the application already has (e.g. a contact form does not ask a
                                    logged in user for an email address). The user is shown progress indicators and
                                    feedback on transactions. Errors resulting from user or data actions are reported to
                                    the user.</p>
                                <p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
                                <p>Evident across all pages/sections and covers interactivity as well as design.
                                    Consistency across all data operations, including in the reporting.</p>
                                <p><strong>Confirmation</strong></p>
                                <p>User and data actions are confirmed where appropriate, feedback is given at all
                                    times.</p>
                                <p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
                                <p>There is clear conformity to accessibility guidelines across all pages/sections and
                                    in all interactivity.</p>
                                <p>Any design decisions that contravene accepted user interaction, user experience
                                    design principles are identified and described (comments in code and/or a section in
                                    the README).</p>
                                <p><strong>Development and Implementation</strong></p>
                                <p>Code demonstrates characteristics of ‘clean code’:</p>
                                <p><strong>Consistent and appropriate naming conventions within code and in file
                                        naming</strong></p>
                                <p>File names, class names, function names and variable names are descriptive and
                                    consistent. For cross-platform compatibility, file and directory names will not have
                                    spaces in them and will be lower-case only. All HTML attributes, CSS rules, code
                                    variables and function names are consistent in format, follow standards for the
                                    language and are appropriate and meaningful. App URLs are consistent.</p>
                                <p><strong>File structure</strong></p>
                                <p>Whenever relevant, files are grouped in directories by file type (e.g. an assets
                                    directory will contain all static files and code may be organised into
                                    subdirectories such as CSS, JavaScript, etc). There is a clear separation between
                                    custom code and any external files (for example, library files are all inside a
                                    directory named 'libraries'). Files are named consistently and descriptively,
                                    without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.</p>
                                <p><strong>Readability</strong></p>
                                <p>Code is indented in a consistent manner to ease readability and there are no
                                    unnecessary repeated blank lines (and never more than 2). ID/class (CSS and
                                    JavaScript)/function/variable names clearly indicate their purpose. All code is
                                    split into well-defined and commented sections. Semantic markup is used to structure
                                    HTML code. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python are kept in separate, linked files. CSS
                                    files are linked in the HTML file’s head element. Non-trivial JavaScript code files
                                    are linked at the bottom of the body element (or bottom of head element if needs
                                    loaded before the body HTML).</p>
                                <p><strong>Defensive design</strong></p>
                                <p>All input data is validated (e.g. presence check, format check, range check).
                                    Internal errors are handled gracefully, and users are notified of the problem where
                                    appropriate.</p>
                                <p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
                                <p>All custom code files include clear and relevant comments explaining the purpose of
                                    code segments.</p>
                                <p><strong>Compliant code</strong></p>
                                <p>HTML code passes through the official W3C validator with no issues. CSS code passes
                                    through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues. JavaScript code passes
                                    through a linter (e.g. jshint.com) with no major issues. Python code is consistent
                                    in style and conforms to the PEP8 style guide (or another explicitly mentioned style
                                    guide, such as Google's).</p>
                                <p><strong>Robust code</strong></p>
                                <p>No logic errors are found when running code. Errors caused by user actions are
                                    handled. Where used, API calls that fail to execute or return data will be handled
                                    gracefully, with the site users notified in an obvious way. Inputs are validated
                                    when necessary. Navigating between pages via the back/forward buttons can never
                                    break the site, there are no broken links. User actions do not cause internal errors
                                    on the page or in the console.</p>
                                <p>The full design is implemented providing a good solution to the users' demands and
                                    expectations and with consideration for security.</p>
                                <p><strong>Real world application</strong></p>
                                <p>Clearly understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum
                                    placeholder text. All links to external pages open in a separate tab when clicked.
                                    The final application is aligned to the user stories presented at the start of the
                                    project.</p>
                                <p>Testing procedures are comprehensive, with a good level of coverage, and have clearly
                                    been followed. All noticeable errors have been corrected or documented:</p>
                                <p>Framework conventions are followed and used correctly.</p>
                                <p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>
                                <p>Controllers. Models. Views. Configuration and settings files are well-organised.</p>
                                <p><strong>Security features and practice are evidenced</strong></p>
                                <p>Passwords and secret keys are stored in environment variables or in files that are in
                                    .gitignore, and are never committed to the repository. Any functionality requiring
                                    log-in is available only to logged-in users. User permissions and levels of access
                                    are appropriate (e.g. a non-admin user would not be able to edit another user’s
                                    post).</p>
                                <p><strong>Data is well structured</strong></p>
                                <p>Data is fully modelled and matches the schema. Data store configuration is kept in a
                                    single location where it can be changed easily. Data is well-structured. All CRUD
                                    functionality is present and working and actions are immediately reflected in the
                                    front end. Configuration and dependencies files are kept up to date. Separate
                                    versions/branches of these are committed where relevant. Data store configuration is
                                    kept in a single location and can be changed easily. The data store is not
                                    accessible to the regular user without going through the code.</p>
                                <p>All noticeable errors have been corrected or documented: Navigating between pages via
                                    the back/forward buttons can never break the site, there are no broken links. User
                                    actions do not cause internal errors on the page or in the console.</p>
                                <p><strong>Version control software is used effectively:</strong></p>
                                <p>All code is managed in git with well-described commit messages. There is a separate,
                                    well-defined commit for each individual feature/fix. There are no very large commits
                                    which make it harder to understand the development process and could lead the
                                    assessor to suspect plagiarism.</p>

                                    reasoning behind it. Wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc., created as part of the
                                    design process are included in the project. There is a clear separation between code
                                    written by the learner and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials).
                                    All code from external sources is attributed to its source via comments above the
                                    code and (for larger dependencies) in the README. The data schema is clear,
                                    comprehensive, and easy to follow. The data schema is fully documented in the README
                                    file. A manual testing procedure is well documented either in the README or a
                                    separate file. The deployment procedure is fully documented in a section in the
                                    README file. Clear, well-described, explanatory commit messages describe the
                                    development process. The README is well-structured and easy to follow. The README
                                    file is written in markdown and uses markdown formatting consistently and
                                    effectively. Project documentation and the application’s user interface have few
                                    errors in spelling and grammar.</p>
